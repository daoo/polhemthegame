Polhem the Game is a simple "The Seal Hunter" like game written by me with
graphics help from my friend Niklas.

Written in Java using the following libraries:

  * [LWJGL](http://lwjgl.org/)
  * [Google GSON](http://code.google.com/p/google-gson/)
  * [Slick](http://slick.cokeandcode.com/)

Running
=======

Should work on Windows and Linux, maybe Mac too but I have not tested that.

Building
========

In addition to the libraries you also need JDK version 7. The code uses some
Java 7 exclusive features.
