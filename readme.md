Polhem the Game is a simple "The Seal Hunter" like game written by me with
graphics help of a friend.

Written in Java using the following libraries:

  * [LWJGL](http://lwjgl.org/)
  * [Google GSON](http://code.google.com/p/google-gson/)
  * [Slick](http://slick.cokeandcode.com/)

Running
=======

Should work on Windows and Linux. Maybe Mac too but I've not tested that.

The only requirement is to have Java installed. To launch the game either run
_windows.bat_ for windows or _linux.sh_ for linux (duh).

Building
========

In addition to the libraries you also need JDK version 7. The code uses some
Java 7 exclusive features.

For building the data zip you need _unzip_ and _gimp_. For zipping and generating

To build everything you could try running _make all_. It might work, though
I've not made any effort to make the Makefile cross platform.
